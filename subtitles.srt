Hi, Kshitij Dwivedi here, a computer science undergrad at Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.

5
00:00:19,265 --> 00:00:26,590
SRFP the Summer Research Fellowship program is organised by the three national Science Academies 

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:33,391
namely Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru, Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi and 

7
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:37,577
The National Academy of Sciences, Prayagraj every year.

9
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:42,809
In this program, students/teachers are offered several two-month Summer Fellowships 

10
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,087
to enable them to work with scientists associated with the three Academies.

12
00:00:49,087 --> 00:00:55,366
Students and teachers from all universities and colleges affiliated to UGC/AICTE/MCI or 

13
00:00:55,366 --> 00:01:00,598
Accredited Institutions of State Universities can apply for these Fellowships.

15
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:09,492
This year in 2021, I have been selected under the SRF Program and assigned under a mentor 

16
00:01:09,492 --> 00:01:16,294
Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar, an Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar.

18
00:01:16,294 --> 00:01:24,142
For this internship I have been tasked to learn the programming language python which is 

19
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:33,036
one of the prominent languages these days due to its wide area applications in the field of 

20
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:39,314
machine learning, data science, artificial intelligence, natural language processing and many more. 

21
00:01:39,314 --> 00:01:45,070
I know the basic constructs of python but not in depth.

23
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:53,441
So, the first task I have been assigned is to create a video introducing myself and 

24
00:01:53,441 --> 00:02:01,812
conversing a paragraph of text having myself as the speaker which I am doing right now.

25
00:02:01,812 --> 00:02:10,706
After this video, I have to extract audio from it and then convert the audio into text. 

26
00:02:10,706 --> 00:02:18,554
In simpler words, a SPEECH TO TEXT based system like Siri, Google AI assistant etc.

28
00:02:18,554 --> 00:02:29,541
Once done, I have to align this text with the video as subtitles to this video with the maximum accuracy possible.

29
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,157
This is my entire task.

30
00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:35,820
We wrap up with the video now.

31
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:39,482
Thanks a lot for listening till here.
