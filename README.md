# SRFP_2021

# Speech Recognition and Forced Alignment of Transcript and Video

The project work aims to develop a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for building Subtitles(.srt) file for the input Video(.mp4).

## Installation

1. Download the project through the below-mentioned link as a ZIP file from GitHub or clone it on your machine. 
Links - [Project Link 1](https://github.com/kshitijdwivedi28/SRFP_2021) or [Project Link 2](https://github.com/ij007/SRPF-2021)

2. Extract the Downloaded ZIP to a folder.

3. Download and Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on your platform through this link 

4. Switch on to your favorite Integrated Development Environment (IDE) as the project is platform-independent (Windows / Linux / MacOSX) as well as IDE-independent (PyCharm, VS Code). I've preferred [Visual Studio Code (VS Code)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) as IDE.

5. Open VS Code on your Platform and Navigate to File Button at the Top Corner.
6. Click Open Folder, browse to your extracted folder, and select that folder.
7. Navigate to the requirements.txt file from the left pane in the folder and install the mentioned modules. Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install.
```
python pip install -r requirments.txt
```
8. Navigate to final_projec.py and run it. Equivalent terminal command - 
```
python final_project.py
```
9. The GUI appears, for the project work requests for the input video file.
10. And as you click on the Generate subtitles button, you will have the resultant subtitles(.srt) file in the input directory of the video file.
