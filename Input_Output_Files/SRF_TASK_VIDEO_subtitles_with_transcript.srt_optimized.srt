Hi, Kshitij Dwivedi here, a computer science undergrad at Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.

4
00:00:19,945 --> 00:00:27,263
SRFP the Summer Research Fellowship program is organised by the three national Science Academies 

5
00:00:27,263 --> 00:00:34,057
namely Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru, Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi and 

6
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:38,239
The National Academy of Sciences, Prayagraj every year.

7
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,466
In this program, students/teachers are offered several two-month Summer Fellowships 

8
00:00:43,466 --> 00:00:49,737
to enable them to work with scientists associated with the three Academies.

9
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:56,010
Students and teachers from all universities and colleges affiliated to UGC/AICTE/MCI or 

10
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:01,237
Accredited Institutions of State Universities can apply for these Fellowships.

11
00:01:01,237 --> 00:01:10,122
This year in 2021, I have been selected under the SRF Program and assigned under a mentor 

12
00:01:10,122 --> 00:01:16,917
Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar, an Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar.

13
00:01:16,917 --> 00:01:24,757
For this internship I have been tasked to learn the programming language python which is 

14
00:01:24,757 --> 00:01:33,642
one of the prominent languages these days due to its wide area applications in the field of 

15
00:01:33,642 --> 00:01:39,914
machine learning, data science, artificial intelligence, natural language processing and many more. 

16
00:01:39,914 --> 00:01:45,664
I know the basic constructs of python but not in depth.

17
00:01:45,664 --> 00:01:54,027
So, the first task I have been assigned is to create a video introducing myself and 

18
00:01:54,027 --> 00:02:02,390
conversing a paragraph of text having myself as the speaker which I am doing right now.

19
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:11,275
After this video, I have to extract audio from it and then convert the audio into text. 

20
00:02:11,275 --> 00:02:19,115
In simpler words, a SPEECH TO TEXT based system like Siri, Google AI assistant etc.

21
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:29,105
Once done, I have to align this text with the video as subtitles to this video with the maximum accuracy possible.

22
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:32,704
This is my entire task.

23
00:02:32,704 --> 00:02:36,364
We wrap up with the video now.

24
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:40,022
Thanks a lot for listening till here.
