Hi, Kshitij Dwivedi here,

4
00:00:17,382 --> 00:00:22,783
a computer science undergrad at Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.

5
00:00:22,783 --> 00:00:27,352
SRFP the Summer Research Fellowship program

6
00:00:27,352 --> 00:00:37,342
is organised by the three national Science Academies namely Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru, Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi

7
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:42,322
and The National Academy of Sciences, Prayagraj every

8
00:00:42,322 --> 00:00:49,897
year. In this program, students, teachers are offered several two-month Summer Fellowships

9
00:00:49,897 --> 00:00:55,613
to enable them to work with scientists associated with the three Academies. Students

10
00:00:55,613 --> 00:01:00,473
and teachers from all universities and colleges affiliated

11
00:01:00,473 --> 00:01:06,357
I have to extract audio

12
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:09,759
Accredited Institutions of State Universities

13
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,291
can apply for these Fellowships.

14
00:01:12,291 --> 00:01:18,341
This year in 2021, I have been selected under the SRF Program

15
00:01:18,341 --> 00:01:22,917
and assigned under a mentor Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar,

16
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:28,415
an Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)

17
00:01:28,415 --> 00:01:37,163
Ropar. For this internship I have been tasked to learn the programming language python which is one of the prominent languages these

18
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:41,308
days due to its wide area applications

19
00:01:41,308 --> 00:01:48,495
in the field of machine learning, data science, artificial intelligence, natural language

20
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:52,905
processing and many more. I know the basic constructs of python

21
00:01:52,905 --> 00:02:02,087
but not in depth. So, the first task I have been assigned is to create a video introducing myself and

22
00:02:02,087 --> 00:02:06,279
conversing a paragraph of text having myself as the speaker which

23
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:13,124
I am doing right now. After this video, I have to extract audio from it and then

24
00:02:13,124 --> 00:02:20,979
convert the audio into text. In simpler words, a SPEECH TO TEXT based system like

25
00:02:20,979 --> 00:02:30,969
Siri, Google AI assistant etc. Once done, I have to align this text with the video as subtitles to this video with the maximum accuracy

26
00:02:31,888 --> 00:02:37,182
with the video now. Thanks a lot for listening
