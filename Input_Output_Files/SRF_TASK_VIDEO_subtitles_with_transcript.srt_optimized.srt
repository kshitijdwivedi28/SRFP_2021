00:00:06,805 --> 00:00:10,321
First few seconds were left blank intentionally 

3
00:00:10,321 --> 00:00:12,832
to adjust for ambient noise.

00:00:12,832 --> 00:00:16,850
Hi, Kshitij Dwivedi here, a computer science undergrad 

5
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:19,864
at Jamia Millia Islamia, New Delhi.

6
00:00:19,864 --> 00:00:22,877
SRFP the Summer Research Fellowship program 

7
00:00:22,877 --> 00:00:26,896
is organised by the three national Science Academies 

8
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:29,909
namely Indian Academy of Sciences, Bengaluru, 

9
00:00:29,909 --> 00:00:33,425
Indian National Science Academy, New Delhi and 

10
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:37,443
The National Academy of Sciences, Prayagraj every year.

11
00:00:37,443 --> 00:00:40,457
In this program, students/teachers are offered 

12
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:42,466
several two-month Summer Fellowships 

13
00:00:42,466 --> 00:00:45,982
to enable them to work with scientists 

14
00:00:45,982 --> 00:00:48,493
associated with the three Academies.

15
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:52,512
Students and teachers from all universities and colleges 

16
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:54,521
affiliated to UGC/AICTE/MCI or 

17
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,534
Accredited Institutions of State Universities can 

18
00:00:57,534 --> 00:00:59,544
apply for these Fellowships.

19
00:00:59,544 --> 00:01:04,063
This year in 2021, I have been selected under 

20
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:08,082
the SRF Program and assigned under a mentor 

21
00:01:08,082 --> 00:01:11,597
Dr. Sudarshan Iyengar, an Associate Professor at 

22
00:01:11,597 --> 00:01:14,612
Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Ropar.

23
00:01:14,612 --> 00:01:18,629
For this internship I have been tasked to 

24
00:01:18,629 --> 00:01:21,141
learn the programming language python 

25
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:25,661
which is one of the prominent languages these days 

26
00:01:25,661 --> 00:01:30,684
due to its wide area applications in the field of 

27
00:01:30,684 --> 00:01:33,698
machine learning, data science, artificial intelligence, 

28
00:01:33,698 --> 00:01:36,711
natural language processing and many more. 

29
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:42,237
I know the basic constructs of python but not in depth.

30
00:01:42,237 --> 00:01:46,756
So, the first task I have been assigned is 

31
00:01:46,756 --> 00:01:50,273
to create a video introducing myself and 

32
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:53,286
conversing a paragraph of text having 

33
00:01:53,286 --> 00:01:58,309
myself as the speaker which I am doing right now.

34
00:01:58,309 --> 00:02:03,332
After this video, I have to extract audio from it 

35
00:02:03,332 --> 00:02:06,847
and then convert the audio into text. 

36
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:11,368
In simpler words, a SPEECH TO TEXT based system 

37
00:02:11,368 --> 00:02:14,381
like Siri, Google AI assistant etc.

38
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:19,906
Once done, I have to align this text with the video 

39
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:24,929
as subtitles to this video with the maximum accuracy possible.

40
00:02:24,929 --> 00:02:27,440
This is my entire task.

41
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,957
We wrap up with the video now.

42
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:34,472
Thanks a lot for listening till here.
